## YSP-Probability-Project
This project solved the Bicycle Leapfrog
# Problem Description
Two friends want to travel to a place 20 miles away, but they only have one bicycle between them. Either
can walk at 2 miles an hour, or ride the bicycle at 10 miles an hour. They decide to proceed as follows: the
first will start by walking, while the second rides the bicycle. After a little while, the one riding will stop,
leave the bicycle by the side of the road, and continue on by walking. When the original walker reaches the
waiting bicycle, they will start riding, and continue until they’ve caught up and gone a little ways past the
now-walker. Then, the bicycle again gets left for the one trailing behind. They continue in this leapfrog
fashion until they’ve both arrived at their destination. If they want to arrive as quickly as possible, does it
matter how frequently they make the bicycle exchange? Simulate this with different possible distributions of
how far they go each time they ride past each other. What happens if the two of them have different walking
speeds, or different riding speeds?
